# Loops Recap

Small series of apps that increase in difficulty. Purpose: to practice the concepts in Section 5. 

<b>Megaphone</b>

<b>Detention</b>

Using a loop that prints user input 99 times with each line being numbered starting from 1.

<b>CountingTool</b>

Counting from 0 to any integer that a user inputs, using scanner and printing on same line. 

<b> Beer </b>
Using For Loop to sing (write out) 99 bottles of beers on the wall song. Loop starts at 99 and finishes at 1. Practicing Decrementing.

<b>Counter Tool Revisited</b>

<b>Guess</b>

<b>Sign In</b>

-However, if username and password are incorrect, user cannot log in and is prompted to try again
-App runs in a loop until correct username and password
